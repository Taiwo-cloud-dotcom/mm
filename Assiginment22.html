        <h1>frequently asked questions</h1>

        1.When should I use "var", "let", and "const"?
<br>
        It is generally recommended to use "let" and "const" over "var" when declaring variables in JavaScript
        because they have more predictable behavior. Use "const" for constant variables that you don't expect to
        change, and use "let" for variables that you expect to change. "var" is not recommended to use because of
        its function-level scope and hoisting behavior.
        <br><br>
        2.Can I reassign a variable declared with "const"?
<br>
        No, you cannot reassign a variable declared with "const".
        If you try to reassign a variable declared with "const", you will get a TypeError.

        <br><br>
        3.What is the temporal dead zone?
<br>
        The temporal dead zone (TDZ) is a behavior that occurs when we try to access a variable declared with
        "let" or "const" before it is declared. It throws a ReferenceError.
